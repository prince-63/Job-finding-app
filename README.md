# Job-finding-app

This is a React Native app that helps users find jobs in their preferred location and category. The app uses the [Job Search API](https://www.jobsearchapi.com/) to fetch the latest job listings from various sources. Users can view the job details, save their favorite jobs, and apply for them directly from the app.

## Features

- User can search for jobs by entering a keyword and a location.
- User can filter the results by selecting a category from a list of options.
- User can see the job title, company name, location, salary, and posted date for each job listing.
- User can tap on a job listing to see more details, such as the job description, requirements, benefits, and how to apply.
- User can save a job listing to their favorites by tapping on the heart icon.
- User can view their saved jobs in a separate tab and remove them if they want.
- User can apply for a job by tapping on the apply button, which will open the job URL in the app's browser.
